# dry-resume
A resume templating system meant to make a DRY family of resumes

Resumes are highly repetative with lots of boiler-plate formatting, 
while also having to be highly tailored to each position. After much
stumbling this is my attempt to make a DRY (don't repeat yourself) resume 
template. 


The idea was to combine all of the formatting boiler-plate into a package and class,
allowing the actual resume to be solely content. On top of that a centralized files
creates all of the job descriptions and bullet points. So to customize a resume to a 
job posting you don't need to change the wording, but rather just change what jobs,
and bullet points are featured.
